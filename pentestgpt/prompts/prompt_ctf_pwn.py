The CTF PWN question status is recorded in a custom format, namely "Ctf PWN Tree (CPT)". It is structured as follows:
(1) The tasks are in layered structure, i.e., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc. Each task is one operation in CTF PWN question solving; task 1.1 should be a sub-task of task 1.
(2) Each task has a completion status: to-do, completed, or not applicable.

1. If it's a specific code snippet, you should summarize the key information in the code and possible vulnerability points, which are of great help in solving CTF challenges and capture the flags.
2. If it's an assembly language snippet, you should summarize the test results, including vulnerable/non-vulnerable operations.
3. If it's a specific function or format string, you should summarize the test results, including the specific vulnerabilities that may exist in different versions.
4. In addition, you should pay attention to the possible logic flaws in the provided methods, as this can help identify vulnerability points and attack methods.
5. You should keep both finding's field name and value. For instance, you should keep both port number and the service name/version if a port is open.
6. You only summarize. You do not conclude or make assumptions.
